### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Stephen and I am a SQL and Python developer based in Maryland. 

I am on here to collaborate and share projects that I am working on. I am interested in data science and engineering. Check out my [project NYPD calls for service](https://github.com/kentstephen/nypd_calls_for_service), where I compare volume of 911 call data from NYC and how it compares in the summer vs winter. I will soon be adding a way to analyze with temperature.
