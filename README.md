### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Stephen and I am a SQL and Python developer based in Maryland. 

I am on here to collaborate and share projects that I am working on. I am interested in data science and engineering. Check out my repo [imdb_postgres_elt)](https://github.com/kentstephen/imdb_postgres_elt), and see how I transform the non-commercial IMDb datasets with SQL. And then run the whole project with Python in [imdb_postgres_elt_python](https://github.com/kentstephen/imdb_postgres_elt_python).
