### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Stepen and I am a SQL and Python developer based in Maryland. I am on here to collaborate and share projects that I am working on. I am interested in data science and engineering. Check out my projecet NYPD calls for service, where I compare volume of 911 call data from NYC and how it compares in the summer vs winter. I will soon be adding a way to analyze with temperature.
